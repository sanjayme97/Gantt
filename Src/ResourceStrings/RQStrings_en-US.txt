# This line is ignored by the plugin 
# Some things this plugin has issues with:
# Namespace for keys doens't work in Chrome. For example: "RadiantQ.SomeKey" doesn't work in Chrome. So we won't use namespaces.
# Multiple placeholders doesn't work in IE9. For example: "SomeKey = value: {0}, {1}" doesn't work in IE9. So, we will only use one place holder.
